🌐 API Used

This project uses the Open-Meteo API, which provides weather and geocoding information.

Geocoding API

Used to find the latitude and longitude of a city:

https://geocoding-api.open-meteo.com/v1/search

Weather API

Used to get current weather and a 7-day forecast:

https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast

No API key is required for this project.

📊 Weather Information

The application displays:

Information| Description
🌡️ Temperature| Current temperature
💧 Humidity| Current relative humidity
🌡️ Feels Like| Apparent temperature
💨 Wind| Current wind speed
🌤️ Weather| Current weather condition
📅 Forecast| 7-day weather forecast

🌦️ Weather Conditions

The application converts Open-Meteo weather codes into easy-to-understand weather conditions.

Examples:

- ☀️ Clear Sky
- 🌤️ Partly Cloudy
- ☁️ Cloudy
- 🌫️ Foggy
- 🌧️ Rain
- ❄️ Snow
- 🌦️ Rain Showers
- ⛈️ Thunderstorm

🌙 Dark Mode

The application includes a Dark Mode feature.

Clicking the Dark Mode button changes the website to a dark theme.

Click the button again to return to Light Mode.

📱 Responsive Design

The Weather App is designed to work on:

- 💻 Desktop
- 💻 Laptop
- 📱 Mobile
- 📱 Tablet

CSS media queries automatically adjust the layout for smaller screen sizes.

🔎 How It Works

Step 1 — Enter City

The user enters a city name in the search box.

Step 2 — Find Location

JavaScript sends the city name to the Open-Meteo Geocoding API.

The API returns:

- City name
- Country
- Latitude
- Longitude

Step 3 — Get Weather

The latitude and longitude are then used to request weather data from the Open-Meteo Forecast API.

Step 4 — Display Weather

JavaScript dynamically updates the webpage with:

- Current temperature
- Humidity
- Feels-like temperature
- Wind speed
- Weather condition

Step 5 — Display Forecast

The daily weather information is converted into seven forecast cards using JavaScript.
